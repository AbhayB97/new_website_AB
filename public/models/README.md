# Note: This is a placeholder for the laptop.glb model
# You would need to place an actual 3D laptop model file here
# 
# For development, the SceneManager creates a laptop from primitives
# but for production, you should have a proper GLB model file
#
# Recommended model specifications:
# - Low-poly laptop model (< 10k triangles)
# - Separate parts for disassembly animation
# - Named meshes: screen, keyboard, battery, ports, motherboard
# - Optimized for web (compressed textures, efficient UV mapping)
